### Adding a New Chart

1. Create a new directory under `charts/`
2. Follow the standard Helm chart structure
3. Include a `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, and `README.md`
4. The release workflow will automatically detect and publish new charts

## Release Process

Charts are released automatically when changes are pushed to `main`:

1. The CI workflow detects which charts have version changes
2. Changed charts are packaged and pushed to Docker Hub OCI registry
3. The GitHub Pages Helm repository index is updated
4. ArtifactHub syncs automatically from GitHub Pages
